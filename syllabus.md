# Visualization Technologies II

## Northeastern University, Spring 2026

#### Instructor: Erica Gunn

6:00-9:30 pm Tuesday, 399 Ryder Hall

### Overview

This class is an exploration of how emerging AI technologies can inform and support data visualization design. Students will experiment with different AI technologies to create a data visualization project over the course of the quarter, and document what they have learned in a portfolio case study.

This class assumes some prior coding experience and familiarity with D3 and other visualization libraries, as taught in VizTech1.

### Objectives

At the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Identify multiple AI tools for design, and discuss benefits and drawbacks of each
- Discuss the experience of using AI in their design projects
- Share project work and course writings with potential employers, demonstrating skills working with AI to achieve design outcomes
- Create articles and artifacts to help other designers explore using AI

### What We'll Do In Class

**Intro** (10-15 mins)
Each class will begin with a brief introduction to the day's topics. Reminders of where we are in the process, upcoming due dates, etc. go here.

**Scrum** (15-20 mins)
This is an opportunity to give brief project updates, discuss status and timelines, and any potential concerns. Each student should take 3-10 minutes to answer the following questions:
* What I worked on this week, and what I got done
* What I learned
* What's next
* What I'm struggling with/what I need

**Class discussion and/or presentations** (30-45 min)
This time will be used for information-sharing about tools we're using and successes, in-depth discussions on common issues or problems, and for student presentations about their work with AI tools.

**Class topics or activities** (30 mins)
Especially in the "Explore" sessions at the beginning of the course, we will do interactive activities or other in-class exercises to help define project goals, audience, and workflows. Later in the course, these discussions will turn toward more technical deep dives on technical aspects related to next stage of the project (such as prompt engineering, or using AI tools to write code).

**Student work and individual consultations** (1.5-2 h)
In most classes, we will have time for individual work and consultations with the instructor on specific tools or tasks where students are getting stuck.

### Course Project

The course project is an opportunity for you to create a visualization related to a topic that you find interesting. Ideally, it will serve as a portfolio piece that you can present to future employers, and we will spend time during the semester creating a portfolio case study to showcase your work.

The project is very broadly defined: you will choose a topic, locate data related to that topic, and clean and present the data in a website using d3 or another visualization tool. You will experiment with incorporating LLMs and other AI technologies to support your project development throughout the quarter, at any and all stages of the project (data acquisition and cleaning, design, project planning and strategy, code, etc). **Sketches, reflections, process notes, Medium articles and final case studies should be created by you, not using AI.**

Final projects must include at least two different views of a dataset, and may incorporate any form that is suited to the data (visual, audio, website or polished video). You will work throughout the semester to identify data, define a project brief, rough out concepts, and create a final visualization that presents your data in a clear and interesting form.

Your Medium articles and case study could focus only on your project outcomes, or they could focus on the process and techniques you developed for using AI in your project (AI workflows for design, documenting iterations with AI, etc.).

### Semester Schedule
Expected topics for each week are listed below. All assignments should be completed before the following class period, and **all updates and code should be published in the correct Git repository before the next class.**

#### Big Picture:
**W1-4:** **Explore** topics, tools, datasets, develop project plan
**W5-12: Produce** project (data, visualizations, etc)
**W12-15:** **Present** project work (case study, exhibition)

#### Semester Deliverables:
* **Weekly reflections and assignments.** Available in [class github repo](https://github.com/VizTech2-Spring2026/studentwork), and submitted there.
*  **2-3 informal class presentations** (10-15 m) on learnings 2-3x in the quarter (Slide template to be provided). Sign up when you have something to share.
* **2 articles published in the** [class Medium publication](https://medium.com/visualization-technologies) 
  on AI tools: what works, what doesn't, what you learned, what you like and don't like.
* **Class exhibition**
* **Formal Case Study** (build the pieces as we go; should be complete by end of quarter)
	* Intro, audience, purpose and tasks
	* Data gathering and processing
	* Visualization development and final form
	* Outcomes and reflection

Medium articles, case study and course reflections are meant to be your opportunity to showcase your process and your unique voice. It is ok to use AI for brainstorming, but writing and final presentation of these deliverables should be yours alone. Any task labeled (human) in weekly assignments should be yours, produced without AI. We are using AI as a tool to support and expedite your process, not to replace the designer or do your work.

### Grade Mapping
**A:** Consistently produces high quality work that goes well beyond the requirements of the assignment. Truly pushing the boundaries of both technology and design. Submits complete, high-quality work on time. Displays significant growth throughout semester. Asks questions, participates in class discussions and critique sessions, helps other students when appropriate. Seeks help when needed, and level of questions indicates significant independent effort and understanding of the course material. Exceeds objectives set for the course.

**B:** Consistently meets standards for assignment, and sometimes goes beyond the requirements for a particular week. Submits complete assignments on time and shows good performance throughout the semester. Works to achieve course requirements, but may not always go beyond them. Asks questions, participates in class discussions and critique sessions sometimes but not always. Seeks help when needed, but also makes a solid attempt to get things working independently. Generally achieves course objectives.

**C and below:** Frequently late or missing assignments threaten class performance. Has continuing problems with assignment submission and publishing, and/or submissions do not fulfill course requirements. Seldom asks questions, participates in critiques, or engages with other students. Does not seek help when needed, or does not try to solve problems independently. Achieves some course objectives, but is still missing significant skills.
