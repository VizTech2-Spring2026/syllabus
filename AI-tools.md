# AI Tools for Design

Part of your task this semester will be to research and evaluate different AI tools that can help you with 
your work. A starter list with some initial suggestions is available below. 

In general, you will need:

- A general-purpose LLM (such as Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity).
- Task-specific tools (image analysis, color selectors, etc.)

A note on cost: Many AI tools are available for free or limited use. Some require a subscription or paid credits. As much as possible, use free services or existing subscriptions for early explorations. Use of paid subscriptions is allowed, but students should not need to pay more than $50/month. Please discuss with instructor before using a larger paid plan.

## Code Tools

For coding technology, I suggest that you use the following basic tools, which should all be familiar from VizTech 1:

- Sublime, VSCode, Webstorm (or another text editor)
- GitHub account
- Github Desktop (optional) If you are not using GitHub Desktop, you will need to download and install the Git application.
- d3 library
- Python
- Slack messaging app (team URL is viztech2jan2026.slack.com)
- Assume that your projects will be viewed in a Chrome web browser
- R/R Studio, plotly, Tableau, or other visualization/analysis tools are allowed but not the main focus of this course. If you are interested in building your project primarily in one of these technologies, discuss with the instructor.

## General research, multi-purpose tools:
Helpful for general research, project planning, or as a “design coach” to critique reasoning, suggest alternatives, generate exercises, and summarize papers.

Can also be used for brainstorming, outlining and developmental editing for written work (discuss with instructor if unsure). Some models (Claude especially) are also optimized for code.
